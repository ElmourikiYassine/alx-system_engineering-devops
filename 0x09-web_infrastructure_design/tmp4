Specifics:

Load Balancer :
Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic between multiple servers.
Why: Improves scalability and ensures high availability by distributing the load.
Distribution Algorithm: Configured for optimal traffic distribution (e.g., round-robin, least connections).
Active-Active Setup: Enables even distribution of traffic across multiple servers.
Server 1 and Server 2:

Purpose: Physical or virtual machines hosting the infrastructure.
Why: Introduces redundancy for increased reliability and scalability.
Web Server (Nginx):

Purpose: Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests.
Why: Efficiently manages web traffic and optimizes resource utilization.
App Server:

Purpose: Executes application logic and processes dynamic content.
Why: Separates application processing from web serving for better scalability.
Application Files:

Purpose: Code base for the website.
Why: Contains the application logic and resources required for website functionality.
Database (MySQL):

Purpose: Stores and retrieves data for the website.
Why: Centralized data storage for the application.

Issues:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure):

Where: Load balancer becomes a potential single point of failure.
Solution: Consider implementing redundancy for the load balancer.
Security:

Issues: Lack of firewall and HTTPS.
Solution: Implement firewalls to enhance security and enable HTTPS for encrypted communication.
Monitoring Absence:

Issue: No monitoring tools in place.
Solution: Implement monitoring tools for performance tracking and issue detection.
